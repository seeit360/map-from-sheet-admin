 Form Upload to google dataset kept as Google Sheet
 companion back end to map-from-sheet

 Concept: 
 Create a tool that could easily populate with datasets of Mass Shootings, because at the time, this was not being tracked by the Federal government and the exising datasets were difficult to visualize or humanize.

 Imagine this as a visual wiki, articles, and stats available via google charts so media could easily visualize the problem and the human beings behind the gun violence, and the victims whose lives were ended. 

 -Features:
 image uploader and editor to google sheet
 microphone with read-ahead
 my own flowform design
 barcode scan and lookup

 This form also populates the fields using a loading schema if the UUID of the dataset entry is known.
